## Layout and Styling Choices

The Recipe Gallery utilizes a modern and minimalist aesthetic to keep the focus on the recipes. Here's an overview of the layout and styling choices:

### Layout:

- **CSS Grid**: The gallery is laid out using CSS Grid, allowing for a flexible and responsive design that adjusts to the screen size and displays the recipes in an easy-to-read format.
- **Card Design**: Each recipe is contained within a card, offering a clean and contained look for each item. This ensures that the user's attention is drawn to one recipe at a time.

### Styling:

- **Color Palette**: The application uses a neutral color palette with a white background and subtle shades of gray for borders and shadows, ensuring that the vibrant colors of the recipe images stand out.
- **Typography**: We've chosen a simple and legible font for easy reading. Recipe titles are bold to differentiate them from the ingredient list.
- **Responsive Images**: Images are set to cover their card space while maintaining their aspect ratio, ensuring visual consistency across the gallery.
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle hover effects on the cards encourage user interaction, signaling that the items are clickable for more details (for future functionality).
- **Media Queries**: Media queries are used to adjust font sizes and card layouts on smaller screens, ensuring readability and a seamless experience on mobile devices.
